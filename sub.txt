00:02	The alpine mountains of Scandinavia. It's an unforgiving environment, where the harsh winter creates a seemingly lifeless void of ice and snow. But one small creature beats the odds, and every few years it emerges unexpectedly from under the snow...
00:21 ...and becomes a social media sensation.
00:36  The Norway lemming might just be the most famous and misunderstood animal in this part of the world.
00:44	And for all it knows, it’s a ferocious rodent with a killer instinct.
00:49 No doubt, in the Nordic mountains, the lemming is the little giant.
01:13 Then the lemmings are gone. Seasons pass without any sign of them.  
So where do they go and when will they reappear...?
01:27 Stretching 1700 kilometers across Norway and Sweden, the Scandinavian alpine region is a world created by the glaciers of the last ice age. 
01:39             Straddling the Arctic circle, this is a land defined by ice and snow, where winter reigns for most of the year.
01:53	Winter temperatures can plunge below minus 40 Celsius, immobilizing the water by nature’s own sculpting craft. 
02:06  	Harsh enough to impede most life, still, this is where we find some of the world’s oldest trees with roots and clones almost ten thousand years old. 
02:18	         But if life above the snow is a challenge, life beneath it is a different story!
02:28 Lemmings!
02:34	The Norway lemming is a small rodent that lives only in Scandinavia. During winter it feeds on mosses under the snow.
03:44	And while they are mostly solitary animals, winter circumstances often force them to congregate. 
02:53 	Under a warming blanket of snow, they find refuge from the weather and potential predators.
03:01 	As tension grows in cramped quarters, some young males get the urge to take a daring hike.
03:19	...in hopes of finding a welcoming female around the corner!
03:26  The young male is quick on the draw and leaves nothing to chance...
03:33	...but he soon finds he was not invited to the party!
03:38  The lemmings build up their populations quietly under the snow. 
In some years their numbers can explode - and this is what helped created the myth about lemmings that lives on unabated.
03:44	Just why the lemming population peaks every fourth year or so is still a bit of a mystery. 
But when it happens, it sets the scene for a spectacular lemming year in the Nordic tundra.
04:12	The raven is ever present in this environment, tolerating the freezing temperatures with ease.
04:19  The red fox however has benefited from climate change - expanding its territories from the forests to the tundra at higher altitudes.
04:32	The red fox’s intrusion into this land has made it a player in the realm of the lemming.
04:43  When the sun returns, temperatures rise... while foxes and ravens await for the next chapter in the lemming story.
05:17  And this next chapter brings one more player to the surface:
05:25	The Arctic fox.
05:28	Having survived here since the ice age, the Arctic fox now faces regional extinction. 
05:40 There are only three to four hundred adult arctic foxes left in Scandinavia. 
05:44                   Subsisting mostly on lemmings, it has suffered from a lack of prey for decades.
05:52	Good lemming years have become rare but hopefully this year will be different.
05:58	But she won’t go hunting just yet. It's too dangerous to be exposed to predators in broad daylight. 
06:14	Instead she relies on a stash of lemmings she caught earlier, now hidden in a natural fridge close to her den.
06:25	Even in a year with a sparse lemming population, her survival chances are good. But for her potential offspring, a good lemming year is a must. If she’s lucky, as many as a dozen pups can be born and survive. In a bad year, with few rodents, it can be a total loss.
06:52  Most other animals leave these mountains in the autumn, migrating to the forests at lower altitudes. 
07:01	Despite the enchanting beauty, the taiga forest can still be a forbidding place.
07:16 Reindeer spend the winter here.
Grazing now means finding the right forest, because their food hangs from the trees: lichen.
07:33 Lichen is their winter staple. But finding it is no easy feat, because it’s cold and the reindeer need to eat a lot.  
07:43 	The food is sparse and sometimes hard to reach.
08:00	Their hooves are like shovels that can lay the ground bare and allow the reindeer to reach the lichen under the snow.
08:10 For the much taller moose, deep snow is no obstacle. 
Feeding on needles and twigs, their food supply is more abundant.
08:28 	Still, it’s a trying time for all, and they can face starvation and death at any time.
08:41	In the twilight darkness of the long winter nights, a phantom of the forest benefits from the spoils of winter. 
08:51 The elusive wolverine is a bad hunter but a very effective scavenger.
It will return to this reindeer carcass many times.
09:10 	 After months of low light, the sun climbs higher in the sky. 
And it signals change. 
09:22 Deep in the genes of many species, evolving over thousands of years, the light triggers an urge to move. 
09:30	Scandinavian reindeer are semi-domesticated. For most of the year they live as wild animals in the vast expanses of the north.
09:45	But for the spring migration back to the alpine highlands, they are herded by their owners: the Sami, the indigenous people of the North.
10:08	 Reindeer husbandry dates back hundreds of years. The knowledge is passed from generation to generation. 
10:17           They follow ancient migration routes over frozen rivers and lakes for hundreds of kilometers.
10:18    It’s a long trek. It can take up to two weeks to reach the mountains. And the Sami must time the migration just right: early enough so the river ice is still thick enough to travel on, but late enough so the pastures are bare when they arrive in the faraway highlands.
